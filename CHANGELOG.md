## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-21

### 🚀 Added
- **Voice-to-Text Dictation** - Integrated Web Speech API for hands-free clinical note input.
- **Advanced Graph Layout Controls** - Added a dropdown menu to dynamically switch between multiple layout algorithms (`Force`, `Hierarchical`, `Circular`, `Grid`, and `Preset`).
- **Layout Customization** - Implemented sliders for real-time adjustment of layout properties like node spacing and physics.
- **Reset View Functionality** - Added a button to easily reset the graph's zoom and position.

### 🎨 Design
- **Complete UI Redesign** - Overhauled the entire interface with a professional dark-mode theme, inspired by modern development environments like Cursor.
- **New Color Palette** - Replaced the light-mode and orange accents with a high-contrast, dark-themed color scheme for improved readability and aesthetics.
- **Component Restyling** - Updated all UI components, including inputs, buttons, and the graph itself, to match the new dark theme.

### 🛠 Technical
- **Performance Optimization** - Debounced slider controls for layout adjustments to prevent excessive re-rendering and improve UI responsiveness.
- **Refactored Layout Logic** - Centralized and improved graph layout algorithms in `src/utils/layout.ts`.
- **Bug Fixes** - Resolved an issue where adjusting layout sliders caused uncontrollable node scaling and zooming.

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **TypeScript Error Resolution** - Fixed all TypeScript errors related to unused variables to ensure a clean build process.
- **Enhanced Graph Stability** - Addressed bugs causing unpredictable graph behavior during layout changes.
